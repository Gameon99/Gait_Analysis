# Introduction
A bipedal walking robot is a kind of humanoid robot. It is supposed to mimic human behavior and designed to perform human specific tasks.
But currently, humanoid robots are not capable of walking like human beings. To perform the walking task, in the current work, human gait data of  6 different walking styles named brisk walk, normal walk,
A very slow walk, medium walk, jogging and fast walk is collected through our configured IMU sensor and mobile-based accelerometer device. 
To capture the pattern for 6 different walking styles, data is extracted for hip, knee, ankle, shank, thigh and foot. A total 6 classes of walking activities are explored for clinical examination. The accelerometer is placed at the center of the human body of 15 male and 10 female subjects. 
In the experimental setup, we have done exploratory analysis over the different gait capturing techniques, different gait features and different gait classification techniques. 
For the classification purpose,three state of art techniques are used as artificial neural networks, extreme learning machine and deep neural network learning based CNN mode. The model classification accuracy is obtained as 87.4%, 88% and 92%, respectively. Here, the WISDM activity data set is also used for verification purposes.
